# NodeMCU-Projects
Some of my NodeMCU (LUA) projects.
Some of these may require different build settings, I may write them down at some point in time.

## DS18S20-Temperature-Sensor
A library for using the Maxim DS18S20 temperature sensor with your NodeMCU.

## WebServer
A very simple web server "library" that can server both static and dynamic sites.

## Examples
### Thermometer
An IoT-Thermometer that displays the current temperature on a webpage as an example for the two libraries.
Requires both the WebServer and DS18S20 libraries from this repo.
